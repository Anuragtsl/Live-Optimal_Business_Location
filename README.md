# Live-Optimal_Business_Location

I have created a model for Identifying Optimal Locations to open a new restaurant in a city to target maximum human population and
minimal competition.

**Different Data explored and can be used for more:-**

* Neighbourhood Competition Data
* Location Data
* Crime rate Data
* People Income Data
* Land Pricing Data
* and more...

# Tech used

[Python](https://www.python.org/), [KMeans](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_k-means.asp), [Foursquare](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kristoft/tutorial-foursquare-api-search), [Geocoding](https://towardsdatascience.com/geocode-with-python-161ec1e62b89), [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

Techniques used: One-hot encoding, feature engineering & selection, segmenting and k-means clustering, geocoding (to get longitude and latitude for places), data scraping using Python library BeautifulSoup (to get neighborhoods corresponding to postal codes and co-ordinates) and Foursquare API.

# Introduction / Business Problem

The success of establishing a new restaurant depends on several factors: demand, brand loyalty, quality of food, competition, and so on. 

In most cases, a restaurant's location plays an essential determinant for its success.

Hence, it is advantageous and of utmost importance to determine the most strategic location for establishment in order to maximize business profits.
