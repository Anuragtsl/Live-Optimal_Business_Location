# Live-Optimal_Business_Location

I have created a model for Identifying Optimal Locations to open a new restaurant in a city to target maximum human population and
minimal competition.

**Different Data explored and can be used for more:-**

* Neighbourhood Competition Data
* Location Data
* Crime rate Data
* People Income Data
* Land Pricing Data
* and more...

# Tech used

[Python](), [KMeans](), [Foursquare](), [Geocoding](), [Beautiful Soup](), [Jupyter Notebook]()

Techniques used: One-hot encoding, feature engineering & selection, segmenting and k-means clustering, geocoding (to get longitude and latitude for places), data scraping using Python library BeautifulSoup (to get neighborhoods corresponding to postal codes and co-ordinates) and Foursquare API.

# Introduction / Business Problem

The success of establishing a new restaurant depends on several factors: demand, brand loyalty, quality of food, competition, and so on. 

In most cases, a restaurant's location plays an essential determinant for its success.

Hence, it is advantageous and of utmost importance to determine the most strategic location for establishment in order to maximize business profits.
